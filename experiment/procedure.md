To conduct the experiment, follow these detailed steps sequentially:

1. **Simulation Setup:**
   - Begin by setting the parameters for the simulation:
     - Determine the mean arrival rate of customers.
     - Select the distribution for service times.
     - Specify the mean service rate.
     - Choose the number of servers for the M/G/c/N model.

2. **Stability Check:**
   - Ensure that the mean arrival rate is less than the product of the mean service rate and the number of servers. This condition is crucial for the existence of a steady-state solution in the system.

3. **System Configuration:**
   - Define the maximum number of customers that the system can accommodate.

4. **Initiating the Experiment:**
   - Click on the 'Start' button to commence the experiment. This action triggers the simulation process with the defined parameters.

5. **Monitoring and Analysis:**
   - As the experiment runs, monitor the system dynamics and performance metrics.
   - If desired, intervene by clicking the 'Stop' button to halt the experiment.

6. **Result Analysis:**
   - After stopping the experiment, examine the steady-state results both numerically and graphically.
   - Compare the theoretical predictions with the experimental outcomes to assess the accuracy and validity of the model.
